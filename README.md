# Wikipedia Data Analysis

This project is a Python script that extracts text from a Wikipedia page, performs text analysis, and generates a graphical representation of the 15 most common words in the text. The analysis includes tokenization, removal of stopwords, word counting, and the creation of a bar chart with word frequencies.

## Overview

The Python script uses various libraries and techniques to analyze text from a Wikipedia page. It processes the text to identify the most common words and generates a bar chart to visualize their frequencies. The script is a great starting point for text analysis and data visualization projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Wikipedia Data Analysis project.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victormeloasm/WikipediaDataAnalysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd WikipediaDataAnalysi
```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The project script is designed to analyze text from a Wikipedia page. Here's how you can use it:

1. Open the `wikipedia_data_analysis.py` script.

2. Set the `url` variable to the Wikipedia page you want to analyze.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python WikipediaDataAnalysis.py
```

4. The script will fetch the Wikipedia page, extract text, perform text analysis, and display a graphical representation of the 15 most common words.
